Molecular Ecology - interactive textbook

I'm not very good at coding or maintaining GitHub, so apologies for anybody peeking in. 

As my advanced undergrad/early grad course in molecular ecology flipped online in spring 2020,
 I used our working experience in R to post new info and assignments with R Markdown so they
 could learn in a flexible way using available data and Shiny simulations (written by Silas Tittes and others).
 
 I think that my goal is to teach in the order it makes sense to me, increasing conceptual
 complexity rather than focusing on technologies for data complexity. This text falls somewhere
 between Joanna Freeland's excellent text on Molecular Ecology and Matt Hahn's excellent text
 on molecular evolution - I'm trying to translate this spread of ideas to generalize it for
 all sorts of inquiries into how biodiversity is always changing. 
 
 At this point I am working on improving it while I teach with it, and running into problems
 making images, links, paths to code etc. work across operating systems, and easily for
 students with no programming or bioinformatic experience to best of my abilities!
 
I would hope - but know it isn't yet always true - that the file MolEcoJan25.Rmd will run on your
machine, using images in "MEImages" and referring to the shiny apps in "shiny_popgen-master".
Thus the paths are important! However please contact me if you need help making it work for your
system, or if you have ideas on how to make it more readily portable to students.
